# Live-Sketcher
This is a simple application of OpenCV

##Live Sketch Algorithm OpenCV:

1. Capturing Real-time Video from the source example – computer’s camera
2. Reading each frame of the video, so that we can make manipulations on the frame.
3. Converting each frame from colored to grayscale, using OpenCV functions.
4. Making Use of Blurring on the grayscale image to remove all the noises on the picture/image. ( Gaussian Blur )
5. Detecting Edges of the blurred image, for making it like a sketch of the person or object. (Canny Edge)
6. Thresholding the Edge Detected image.
