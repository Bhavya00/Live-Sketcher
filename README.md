Capturing Real-time Video from the source example – computer’s camera
Reading each frame of the video, so that we can make manipulations on the frame.
Converting each frame from colored to grayscale, using OpenCV functions.
Making Use of Blurring on the grayscale image to remove all the noises on the picture/image. ( Gaussian Blur )
